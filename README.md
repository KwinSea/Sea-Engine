# Sea Engine

Sea Engine is a game engine built using C++ and a mix of tools/api like OpenGL and ImGui. It is far from finished and still in development. Sea engine was originally a school project for my C++ graphics class but grew into a fun side project that is ment to be more hands on then other engine. A deep understanding of C++ is recommended.

Note: This repo is the development build, meaning it will contain a lot of random assets, textures, and scenes ment to assist development. Any release version will have these assets removed, so your own assets are required.
