# Sea Engine

Sea Engine is a game engine built using C++ and a mix of tools/api like OpenGL and ImGui. It is far from finished and still in development. Sea Engine was originally a school project for my C++ graphics class but grew into a fun side project that is meant to be more hands on than other engine. A deep understanding of C++ is recommended.

I plan to support other model formats since **_.ply_** is the only accepted format. The next thing I want to add is collision and reformat how light objects are handled to make scripting easier.

### Basic Controls

| Cycle Objects | `Shift` + `[` or `]`                |

| Highlight Light | `CTRL` + `T`                      |


Note: This repo is the development build, meaning it will contain a lot of random assets, textures, and scenes meant to assist development. Any release version will have these assets removed, so your own assets are required.
